## Snake Game
#### @Author Jéssica Araújo

### Summary

- You control a Snake that moves around in a grid, the snake spans over 3 cells at the beginning.
- You can only turn the snake left or right and it moves one cell every "game turn".
- There is always one food pellet on the grid.
- Goal of the game is to eat said pellets by moving the snake to its position.
- When the snake eats a pellet it grows one cell longer.
- If the snake collides with itself, the game is lost.
- If the snake reaches one of the grid's borders, it wraps around (i.e. going out on the left side means you come back in on the right side).
